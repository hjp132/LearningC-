Implement another table just for adding food types
Give the user the ability to add and remove types of food 
Add validation for each use case ie ( if a food type that is being used is removed ) 



- Things that need to be worked out:
How to link the CuisineTypes back to the restaurants and how to properly refer them? 
( Possibly: get a cusinetype id and retrieve name from that?)
